# lambda_layers_challenge
This repository is geared toward facilitating the adoption of optimal fixed memory lambda functions.  From a business perspective, minimizing the memory footprint of a lambda function reduces the cost component for each invocation.  From a technical perspective, understanding how to structure Python 3.6 using well-architected layers, is the overarching purpose of this repository.
