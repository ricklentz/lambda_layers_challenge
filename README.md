# Python 3.6 AWS Lambda Layers Challenge
This repository is geared toward facilitating memory optimization for Python 3.6 lambda function's dependancies.  From a business perspective, minimizing the memory footprint of a lambda function reduces cost for every invocation.  This repo will focus on providing layered lambda examples using composition of common machine learning libraries.
